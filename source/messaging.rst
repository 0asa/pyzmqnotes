Messaging or Messaging Middleware
=====================================

Messaging connects applications running on a variety of platforms, and written in a variety of languages, across a network. 
It is one of the solution in decoupling and creating distributed applications. 
It helps in scaling where services could be handled by different applications that does one job well.
Distributed applications are also easier to change compared to a monolithic applications.
It's expensive to try to define the behavior of each of many software applications that work together in a large network. 
It's much cheaper, and more flexible, to define the interfaces between them: the APIs. Messaging is an API that can be stretched across a network
